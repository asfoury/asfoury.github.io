# The Streaming war 

Streaming servicesâ€™ market is considerably growing each year. They are revolutionizing the movie industry. For a long period of time, Netflix was dominating the market in all aspects. Now the streaming war is raging on. The King is being overtaken by growing competitors like Disney plus, Amazon Prime and HBO. To come on top of this furious battle, each streaming service is now launching its own content in addition to acquiring old content. For consumers, choosing which streaming platform to subscribe to is becoming harder than ever. Our goal is to provide insights on which platform offers the best value for movie lovers and help users make informed decisions when choosing a streaming service. We will focus on analyzing movies available on Netflix and Amazon Prime to determine which platform offers a better selection. We will be using data on movie ratings, duration, genre and other relevant features to compare the two platforms.

# Where's your favorite movie?

As streaming platforms continue to grow and evolve, it can be difficult to keep track of what movies are available on which platforms. Netflix and Amazon Prime don't provide data about the movies they are offering. Addintionaly, there are no up to date datasets about movies on different platform. Therefore, we decided to take matters into our own hands.

To construct our dataset, we used the IMDb movie data and augmented it with information on which streaming services each movie was available on, using the MovieDB API. For each movie in the IMDb dataset, we made a call to the API to check which streaming platforms it was available on.

We then explored our obtained dataset and decided to focus our analysis on the US market, where the competition between streaming platforms is fierce. After looking at the various streaming services, we found that we had the most data for movies available on Netflix and Amazon Prime. In total, we ended up with 6981 movies for Amazon Prime and 2915 movies for Netflix. If we assume that the movie offerings on these two platforms did not change, we would have access to 99% of movies on Prime and 60% of movies on Netflix. In the following sections of our data story, we'll explore how we can handle this issue and compare the movies on these platforms in more detail.
