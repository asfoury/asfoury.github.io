# Introduction

Streaming services‚Äô market is considerably growing each year. They are revolutionizing the movie industry. For a long period of time, Netflix was dominating the market in all aspects. Now the streaming war is raging on. The King is being overtaken by growing competitors like Disney plus, Amazon Prime and HBO. To come on top of this furious battle, each streaming service is now launching its own content in addition to acquiring old content. For consumers, choosing which streaming platform to subscribe to is becoming harder than ever. Our goal is to provide insights on which platform offers the best value for movie lovers and help users make informed decisions when choosing a streaming service. We will focus on analyzing movies available on Netflix and Amazon Prime to determine which platform offers a better selection. We will be using data on movie ratings, genre, and other relevant features to compare the two platforms.

# Motivation
We constructed our dataset by using the imdb movie data and augmenting it with the availability on the corresponding 
streaming service using the moviedb api. For each movie in the imdb dataset we made a call to the api to check the movie 
is available on which streaming service. We then explored our obtained dataset and decided to focus our study on the US market, because this is where we had the most data.

After that we looked at the different streaming services and found that we had the most data for Netflix and Amazon Prime, 
so we decided to focus our study on these two platforms. After constructing our dataset we ended up with 6981 movies for 
Amazon Prime, and 2915 movies on Netflix. Using the blog post above, if we assume that the movies on those two platforms
did not change we would have 99% of movies on Prime and 60% of movies on Netflix. We will see in the following parts how we 
will handle this issue.

To measure quality we decided to use the imdb rating, because it is a well known metric and it is used by many people to
decide which movie to watch.

### Sentiment & Topics on Prime and Netflix

In our research to determine if Netflix had better quality movies than Amazon Prime, we looked at the description of the movies. First, we were interested in the sentimental aspect of these descriptions. The sentiment of a movie can be defined by two values: polarity and subjectivity. The polarity determines how negative/positive a text is, and the subjectivity how objective/subjective it is.  
The two plots below show you the distribution of polarity and subjectivity for Netflix and Prime. We can see that Prime has slightly more negative movie descriptions than Netflix. This difference in distribution could have an effect on the rating of movies between the different platforms. Indeed, it could be possible that movies with a "negative" feeling are less well rated in general or vice versa. In order to have the most robust comparison possible between the ratings of Neflix and Prime, we will therefore take into account the polarity of the films in our observational study, in order to limit this potential bias as much as possible. Subjectivity would rather allow us to choose which films we would choose for our observational study. Indeed, objective descriptions (thus with a subjectivity score close to zero) would be more rigorous to analyze, because it limits a certain bias towards the films. However, given the distribution, keeping only the films with a low subjectivity would have left us with too few films, impacting too much the robustness of our observational study. For this reason we did not keep this metric in the rest of our analysis.
